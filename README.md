# Webpage Modeling Cirrus Aircraft

This webpage was designed following a youtube tutorial titled ["Awesome 3D ANIMATION Javascript Tutorial!" created by Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK7T3mY1V-w).

Utilizing my passion for aviation, I tailored this as a way to show off various Cirrus aircraft. The images stored here are from the official [Cirrus website](https://cirrusaircraft.com/).
